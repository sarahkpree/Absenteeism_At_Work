### Project Overview
This analysis addresses three key questions related to employee wellness, smoking habits, and absenteeism management:

1. **Identifying the Healthiest Employees:** A thorough examination of employee data reveals 111 individuals meeting specific health criteria, entitling them to a bonus from a $100,000 allocation. Each eligible employee is set to receive approximately $900 as recognition for their healthy lifestyle choices and low absenteeism.

2. **Non-Smoker Identification:** By leveraging data insights, 686 non-smoking employees are identified, warranting a budget allocation of $983,221 from the HR department. An hourly increase rate of $0.68 is determined for these employees, aiming to incentivize and promote a smoke-free workplace environment.

3. **Dashboard Development for Absenteeism Monitoring:** The analysis extends to creating a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for HR, facilitating a deeper understanding of absenteeism trends. 

### Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Absenteeism_at_work.csv" file, containing detailed information about employee information including absence details, lifestyle choices, and health indicators. In addition, there is a "Reasons.csv" file which lists the possible reasons for absenteeism and a "Compensation.csv" file which lists every employees hourly wage.
