### Project Overview
This analysis addresses three key questions related to employee wellness, smoking habits, and absenteeism management:

1. **Identifying the Healthiest Employees:** A thorough examination of employee data reveals 111 individuals meeting specific health criteria, entitling them to a bonus from a $100,000 allocation. Each eligible employee is set to receive approximately $900 as recognition for their healthy lifestyle choices and low absenteeism.

2. **Non-Smoker Identification:** By leveraging data insights, 686 non-smoking employees are identified, warranting a budget allocation of $983,221 from the HR department. An hourly increase rate of $0.68 is determined for these employees, aiming to incentivize and promote a smoke-free workplace environment.

3. **Dashboard Development for Absenteeism Monitoring:** The analysis extends to creating a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for HR, facilitating a deeper understanding of absenteeism trends. 

### Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Absenteeism_at_work.csv" file, containing detailed information about the employees including absence details, lifestyle choices, and health indicators. In addition, there is a "Reasons.csv" file which lists the possible reasons for absenteeism and a "Compensation.csv" file which lists every employees' hourly wage. 

### Tools

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the employee data to answer key questions, such as:
1. Who are the healthiest employees? "Healthy" is defined as a non-smoker, non drinker, a BMI less than 25, and absent less than the employee average absent hours.
2. Who are the employees that do not smoke?
3. What is the most common reason for absenteeism?
4. Is there a particular month or day of the week with higher absenteeism rates?
5. Do employees with higher education levels tend to have lower absenteeism rates?
